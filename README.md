# Spam-Message-Detection
Dive into the realm of machine learning with this Spam Classifier implemented in Python using the Naive Bayes algorithm! This repository showcases a simple yet effective spam detection model, utilizing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the scikit-learn library.

Features:

Spam Classification: Train and deploy a Spam Classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) messages.

Data Visualization: Explore the distribution of spam and ham messages through an insightful heatmap, offering a visual representation of message counts.

Interactive Usage: Easily test the classifier by inputting your own messages and witnessing real-time predictions.

Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn).
Run the script, providing your own input message to witness the classifier in action.
Contribution Guidelines:

Fork the repository, create a new branch, and contribute improvements, optimizations, or additional features.
Engage in discussions to share insights, suggestions, or ways to enhance the Spam Classifier.
Example Usage:

python
Copy code
# Example usage
sample = input('Enter a message:')
data = cv.transform([sample]).toarray()
print(clf.predict(data))
